    <h1 class="online">why is my business running down?</h1>
    
    <p>there are many circumstances that makes a business run down</p>
    <li>Zero concentration</li>
    <li>Lack of savings</li>
    <li>uncontentment</li>
    <hr>

<br><br>

<h1 class="earn">Zero concentration?</h1>
<h4 class="head_1">what do we mean by zero concentration; at times when we start making huge amount of money in our businesses, we have no mindset of restoring another stock, we keep focusing on how bigger it will be in the next one day, we have many people today who have fall a victim in this process.

</h4>

<h1 class="earn">Lack of savings?</h1>

<h4 class="head_1">Hmmmm!, many people are passing through this process till today. Don't joke with your business, opportunity comes once, once is gone, that's the end, how do you manage to save?</h4>
<h4 class="head_1">have you forgotten the chain of distribution:(manufacturer/producer —> wholesaler —> retailer    —> Final consumer). A manufacturer/producer produce a wall clock, which cost him the sum of $2 for the materials and he produce about ten thousand (10,000) wall clock in total and distribute them for the sum of $5 per one wall clock, he made a profit of $30,000 for the whole ten thousand(10,000) wall clock he produced,he produced five hundred (500) wall clock per day,he decide to save $15,000 and pay his workers $10,000 and use the remaining $5,000 for expenses and liabilities.
<br>
<h4>
How much did he gain per wall clock? it is obvious that his profit is $3 per wall clock. 
Now tell me with this kind of bussiness can't he survive, he will surely survive and his business will grow bigger and better to the extence that at the end of the day the business will last longer for everlasting.
</h4>
</h4>

<h1 class="earn">Uncontentment?</h1>
<h4 class="head_1">This is a spirit whereby it manifest over people and make them loose there business,we know life is about competition, be satisfied with what you have. A wholesaler and a retailer, a wholesaler are those who sells in bulk while a retailer are those who sells in a bit to the final-consumer. X is a wholesaler, Y is a retailer, X sells in bulk and ordered for new stock everyday, Y sells in a small quantity and ordered for goods once in a month, X shop as been founded in the year 2000, Y shop as been founded in the year 2010.
<br> <h4>
 X was once a retailer before X became a wholesaler, Y as been planning to move like X, but is not Y time to do that, Y tried all possible best to do that, Y went to a loan office to borrow loan that is more than it's expectation, Y manage to borrow the loan and now a wholesaler and sells in bulk,when is time to pay back 50% of the loan, Y bussiness is not well function like before, is business began to ruin till it became worst is bussiness as run down finally to the fact that it is empty. This is what is happening to many of the bussiness holder today.

    <marquee class="bonaza">BONAZA BONAZA!!....Advertise your bussiness for free! be a bussiness tycoon.  Headline News The history of Nigeria can be traced back to the early Stone Age. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was inhabited by hunter-gatherers as early as 9000 BC. The Nok culture emerged in the region around 1000 BC and left behind terracotta sculptures and iron tools. The Nok culture is believed to have been the earliest in West Africa.

By the 11th century, the Yoruba people had established the Oyo and Benin kingdoms in the region. The Yoruba people were known for their strong trading networks and their advanced agricultural methods.

In the 15th century, the region was colonized by the Songhai Empire, which brought Islam to the region. In the late 16th century, the region was colonized by the British. The British established a protectorate in the region in 1900 and the region was formally annexed in 1914.

In 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from Britain and became a republic. Since then, Nigeria has experienced a series of military coups and civil wars. The most recent of these was the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-1970.

Today, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and one of the most populous countries in the world. It is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation and is home to over 500 ethnic groups and over 250 languages. Nigeria is a major oil producer and is one of the world's fastest growing economies.</marquee>
